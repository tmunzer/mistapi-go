`StatsMxedgeMemoryStat`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Active` | `*int` | Optional | The amount of memory, in kilobytes, that has been used more recently and is usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary. |
| `Available` | `*int64` | Optional | An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping. |
| `Buffers` | `*int` | Optional | The amount, in kilobytes, of temporary storage for raw disk blocks. |
| `Cached` | `*int` | Optional | The amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes, used as cache memory. |
| `Free` | `*int64` | Optional | The amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes, left unused by the system |
| `Inactive` | `*int` | Optional | The amount of memory, in kilobytes, that has been used less recently and is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes. |
| `SwapCached` | `*int` | Optional | The amount of memory, in kilobytes, that has once been moved into swap, then back into the main memory, but still also remains in the swapfile. |
| `SwapFree` | `*int` | Optional | The total amount of swap free, in kilobytes. |
| `SwapTotal` | `*int` | Optional | The total amount of swap available, in kilobytes. |
| `Total` | `*int64` | Optional | Total amount of usable RAM, in kilobytes, which is physical RAM minus a number of reserved bits and the kernel binary code |
| `Usage` | `*int` | Optional | - |
| `AdditionalProperties` | `map[string]interface{}` | Optional | - |
