
# Mxcluster Tunterm Hosts Selection Enum

Ordering of tunterm_hosts for mxedge within the same mxcluster.

* When `shuffle`, the ordering of tunterm_hosts is randomized by the deviceâ€™s MAC.
* When `shuffle-by-site`, we shuffle by site_id+tunnel_id (so when client connects to a specific Tunnel, it will go to the same (order of) mxedge, and we load-balancing between tunnels).
* When `ordered`, the order is decided by tunterm_hosts_order
