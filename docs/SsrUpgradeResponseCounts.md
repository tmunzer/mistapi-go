## Methods

### NewSsrUpgradeResponseCounts

`func NewSsrUpgradeResponseCounts(failed int32, queued int32, success int32, upgrading int32, ) *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts`

NewSsrUpgradeResponseCounts instantiates a new SsrUpgradeResponseCounts object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewSsrUpgradeResponseCountsWithDefaults

`func NewSsrUpgradeResponseCountsWithDefaults() *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts`

NewSsrUpgradeResponseCountsWithDefaults instantiates a new SsrUpgradeResponseCounts object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetFailed

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetFailed() int32`

GetFailed returns the Failed field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetFailedOk

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetFailedOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetFailedOk returns a tuple with the Failed field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetFailed

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) SetFailed(v int32)`

SetFailed sets Failed field to given value.


### GetQueued

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetQueued() int32`

GetQueued returns the Queued field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetQueuedOk

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetQueuedOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetQueuedOk returns a tuple with the Queued field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetQueued

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) SetQueued(v int32)`

SetQueued sets Queued field to given value.


### GetSuccess

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetSuccess() int32`

GetSuccess returns the Success field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetSuccessOk

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetSuccessOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetSuccessOk returns a tuple with the Success field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetSuccess

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) SetSuccess(v int32)`

SetSuccess sets Success field to given value.


### GetUpgrading

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetUpgrading() int32`

GetUpgrading returns the Upgrading field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetUpgradingOk

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) GetUpgradingOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetUpgradingOk returns a tuple with the Upgrading field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetUpgrading

`func (o *SsrUpgradeResponseCounts) SetUpgrading(v int32)`

SetUpgrading sets Upgrading field to given value.
